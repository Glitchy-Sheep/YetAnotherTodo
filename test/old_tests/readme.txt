These are tests that helped me a lot with 
local and remote investigations.

I fix plenty of mere mistakes in the model's to/from json errors.

But they don't meet the standard of testing.
There should be mock objects.
So until real useful tests are created 
with basic testing rules in mind, let them be here.
